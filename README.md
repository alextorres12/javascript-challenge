# Javascript Challenge
Northwestern University Data Science Boot Camp

[Homework 14](https://nu.bootcampcontent.com/NU-Coding-Bootcamp/nu-chi-data-pt-08-2020-u-c/tree/master/02-Homework/14-Intro-To-JavaScript/Instructions)

In this project, I utilized Javascript and the D3.js library to filter data and display that data on a web page. I filtered the data based on user input by using D3.js event listeners, js filter functions, and forEach functions. Then I displayed the data by selecting the relevant HTML elements, clearing the data on the page, and re-appending new rows to a table without necessitating a refresh.
